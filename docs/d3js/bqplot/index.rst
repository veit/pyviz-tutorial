bqplot
======

2-D plot library for Jupyter notebooks

`bqplot <https://bqplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is based on `The Grammar of
Graphics (Statistics and Computing)
<https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/0-387-28695-0>`_.

Goals
-----

Unified framework for 2D visualisations
    with a Pythonic API
Extensible API
    allows the addition of user interactions (panning, zooming, selection,
    :abbr:`etc. (et cetera)`)
Customised API
    Users can create their own visualisations using the internal object model
    inspired by The Grammar of Graphics (figure, marks, axes, scales) and their
    visualisations can be explored interactively
Context-based API
    similar to Matplotlibâ€™s ``pyplot``, meaningful choices are provided for most
    parameters
