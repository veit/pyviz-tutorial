hvPlot
======

Many libraries such as :doc:`/matplotlib/pandas/index`, `xarray
<https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/>`_, `Dask
<https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/>`_, `Streamz
<https://streamz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ and
:doc:`python4datascience:data-processing/intake/index` have a high-level plot
API, mostly based on  :doc:`/matplotlib/index`. However, they do not offer the
advantages of modern web APIs, such as  :doc:`/bokeh/index` and `HoloViews
<https://holoviews.org>`_. `hvPlot <https://hvplot.holoviz.org/>`_
hvPlot is a high-level plot API based on HoloViews, which offers a general and
consistent API for plotting all the formats mentioned above.
