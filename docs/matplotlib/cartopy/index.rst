Cartopy
=======

`Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ creates maps based on
:doc:`/matplotlib/index` and converts points, lines and vectors between the
different projections. It is based on `PROJ.4 <https://proj.org/en/9.2/>`_,
`NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ and `Shapely <https://pypi.org/project/shapely/>`_.
`Pyresample <https://pyresample.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ uses Cartopy to
convert `SatPy <https://satpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ data into the
different projections.
